            <p class="info">My name is Taylor Goldman, and I am a junior computer science student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
                I am very passionate about computer science, specifically cybersecurity and software development, and I really enjoy creating new
                things from what I learn. At school I am involved on the women's tennis team, the Computer Science and Software Engineering department's 
                peer mentoring program as well as a TA for the department, Society of Women Engineers, and Cybersecurity Club. 
            </p>
            <p class="info">I am hoping to gain some more experience in the field of computer science with an internship. Feel free to check out some 
                of my recent projects on my portfolio page, or my resume that you can also find on this website. My email is displayed below, please reach
                out if you have any questions!
