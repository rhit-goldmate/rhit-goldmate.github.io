            <p class="info">My name is Taylor Goldman, and I am a recent graduate of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology with a Bachelor's in 
                Computer Science and a minor in Cybersecurity. I am deeply passionate about computer science, particularly in 
                cybersecurity and software development, and I enjoy creating innovative solutions based on my knowledge and experiences.
                 In my time at Rose-Hulman, I was actively involved in the women's tennis team, the Computer Science and Software 
                 Engineering department's peer mentoring program, and as a TA for the department, as well as 
                 an active member of the Cybersecurity Club.</p>
            
            <p class="info">I recently started a position as a Cybersecurity Consultant, where I configure custom solutions for clients, 
                ensuring their security needs are effectively met. I am also looking to dive deeper into personal projects in cybersecurity 
                and software engineering to further hone my skills and contribute to the field. Feel free to check out some of my recent
                projects on my portfolio page, or download my resume. My email is displayed below; please reach out
                if you have any questions or collaboration ideas!</p>
