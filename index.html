            <p>My name is Taylor Goldman, and I am a sophomore computer science student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. 
                I am very passionate about computer science, cybersecurity, and software development, and I really enjoy creating new 
                things from what I learn. At school I am involved on the women's tennis team, Society of Women Engineers, and 
                cybersecurity club. </p>

            <p>I am hoping to gain some more experience in the field of computer science with an internship. Feel free to check out 
                some of my recent projects on my portfolio page, or my resume that you are also able to find on this website. </p>
